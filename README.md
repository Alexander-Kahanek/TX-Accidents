# TX-Accidents
The HTML file is the final output delivery.

The rmd file is what the project was created on.

The R script is a short script I made to help clean the data before loading it into the rmd for analysis.

GOAL
---------------
The goal of this project was to work as a team to create a cohesive Exploratory Data Analysis. We focused the analysis around the patternning of accident occurrence between weekdays and weekends. This was used to analyze which highways are effected the most between these two categories of days. We also created an interactive map that helps visualise the accidents in Texas that occured in 2019, to help understand the patterns of these accidents.
