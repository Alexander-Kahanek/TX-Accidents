# TX-Accidents

This project was created by Alexander Kahanek and Austyn McLaughlin

* The HTML file is the final output delivery. [This can be seen here...](https://alexander-kahanek.github.io/project/accidents.html)

* The rmd file is what the project was coded and created on.

* The R script is a short script I made to help clean the data before loading it into the rmd for analysis.

* The raw data is not included, as it is too large for github, however it can be found on kaggle [here...](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)

GOAL
---------------
The goal of this project was to work as a team to create a cohesive Exploratory Data Analysis. We focused the analysis around the patternning of accident occurrence between weekdays and weekends. This was used to analyze which highways are effected the most between these two categories of days. We also created an interactive map that helps visualise the accidents in Texas that occured in 2019, to help understand the patterns of these accidents.
