Download both the .html file and the .rmd file

The HTML file will be what the final delivery will look like, please use this as a 'guide' on how to format your analysis.

GOAL
-----
Write a small Analysis over an aspect of the data you find interesting. For example, I have chosen to write over the number of accidents for each weekday, and will do an analysis over this.

There are a few interesting things I pointed out in the beginning summary, if you need help feel free to reach out!

Also, please write the analysis at the bottom of the .rmd file, and make sure that everything runs properly so that we can stitch together everybodies small analysis.
